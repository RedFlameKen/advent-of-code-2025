# Advent Of Code 2025
this year, I want to learn rust. not because the hype has got to me. It's just
because I wanna work on some rust based projects.

## Inputs
create a directory `inputs` and put your input files there simply named by day.
For example, to put your day1 inputs, simply create a file with the path
`inputs/day1` containing the inputs for that day.

## Running
just run the program with the selected day as the first argument. For part twos
of days, simply add **p2** at the end of the day name. For example, part two of
`day1` would be `day1p2`.

sample run with **rustc**:
```bash
rustc src/main.rs; ./main day1p2
```

sample run with **cargo**:
```bash
cargo run day1p1
```
